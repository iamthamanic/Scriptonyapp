## 12. Known Constraints & Design Decisions

### 12.1 Beat Display
**Decision:** Beats ONLY shown in Timeline view
**Rationale:** 
- Avoid clutter in writing interface
- Separation of planning vs. writing modes
- Timeline is dedicated planning tool

### 12.2 Ripple Editing Asymmetry
**Decision:** Right handle ripples, left handle doesn't
**Rationale:**
- Matches industry-standard video editors (CapCut, Premiere, DaVinci)
- Most natural for users
- Prevents accidental timeline shifts when trimming starts

### 12.3 Database Migrations
**Constraint:** No DDL/migration files in codebase
**Rationale:**
- Single KV table sufficient for prototyping
- Users may modify DB via Supabase UI
- Avoid sync issues between code and DB schema
- Flexible schema in KV store

### 12.4 Manual Edge Function Deployment
**Decision:** Copy-paste deployment via Dashboard (no CLI)
**Rationale:**
- User preference
- Better control over deployment timing
- Visual verification before deploy
- Clear deployment audit trail
